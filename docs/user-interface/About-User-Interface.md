This page explains the structure of the User Interface sub-project, provides links to its design resources, and outlines how to contribute to Flipper One's UI development.

![About User Interface](/files/pics/about-ui-main-image.jpg)

The User Interface sub-project covers the visual and interaction design of Flipper One: the on-screen UI, graphic elements, icons, illustrations, and the design assets used to build them.

The User Interface sub-project consists of:

- ✅ [Task tracker](https://github.com/orgs/flipperdevices/projects/12)
- 🎨 [Asset library on Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/U4k0qHkl9JdCu17MEtLFdI/Flipper-One-UI-Assets-library?node-id=0-1&t=zfmlKGksE4iBQ57H-1) — core components for building UI
- 🖼️ [Main board on Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/PhlEqdtgjFfcizdVV0qNSR/Flipper-One-UI---Main-board?node-id=368-270&t=YcLCv1SFsc4TCTiV-1) — assembled UI layouts and design documentation
- 📁 [GitHub repository](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperone-ui) — currently contains only a README

We'd love your feedback — look for tasks tagged **help wanted** in the task tracker, share your designs in the comments, or contribute directly to the docs.

## ✅ Task tracker

All User Interface team tasks are tracked in the GitHub project [Flipper One — User Interface](https://github.com/orgs/flipperdevices/projects/12). There, you can see what the design team is working on and follow progress and discussions.

![User Interface task tracker](/files/pics/ui-task-tracker.png "User Interface sub-project task tracker on GitHub")

**Some tasks are open** to the community and marked with a **help wanted** label. You're welcome to join the discussion on these tasks or submit your design proposals — just make sure to read the [Contribution guide](./#how-to-contribute) first.

## 🎨 Asset library on Figma

The [Asset library](https://www.figma.com/design/U4k0qHkl9JdCu17MEtLFdI/Flipper-One-UI-Assets-library?node-id=0-1&t=zfmlKGksE4iBQ57H-1) hosts the core Figma components used to build Flipper One's UI. You can browse it in your browser without a paid Figma plan — just open the link.

![Flipper One Asset library on Figma](/files/pics/figma-library-overview.jpg "Flipper One Asset library on Figma")

The library has two pages:

- **UI — Prototype Assets** — components for mockups and hypothesis testing inside Figma. Uses orange and black screen-like colors that mimic the Flipper One display.
- **UI — Dev ready** — components for building UI that will be shipped to the Flipper One screen.

:::hint{type="info"}
If you have a paid Figma plan, you can add the Asset library to your team libraries for use across projects. See [Figma's guide to libraries](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041051154-Guide-to-libraries-in-Figma).

## 🖼️ Main board on Figma

The [Main board](https://www.figma.com/design/PhlEqdtgjFfcizdVV0qNSR/Flipper-One-UI---Main-board?node-id=368-270&t=YcLCv1SFsc4TCTiV-1) hosts interface development, design assets, illustrations, and source graphics files.

![Flipper One Main board on Figma](/files/pics/figma-main-board-overview.png "Flipper One Main board on Figma")

The Main board has three pages:

- **Documentation** — illustrations and technical drawings.
- **UI OUT** — development-ready, assembled UI layouts.
- **UI Live Preview** — pre-assembled UI layouts for look-and-feel tests on the device.

***

## Display constraints

Flipper One's display has specific constraints all UI designs must follow:

- **Resolution:** 256 × 144 px
- **Color depth:** 64 shades of black (6-bit grayscale)
- **Backlight:** orange LCD
- **Pixel-perfect rendering:** UI elements must align to whole pixels — sub-pixel rendering is not supported

Keep these in mind when designing screens, icons, or illustrations — anything that doesn't respect them won't render correctly on the device.

***

## Fonts

The UI uses two fonts:

- [Born2bSportyV2](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/blob/master/tools/font/ttf/Born2bSportyV2.ttf) — primary UI font.
- [haxrcorp4089](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/blob/master/tools/font/ttf/haxrcorp4089.ttf) — secondary UI font.

***

## Prototypes (deprecated)

Earlier prototypes based on ProtoPie are deprecated — they were used when we couldn't prototype directly on the Flipper One screen. They remain accessible in the [flipperone-ui repository](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperone-ui) for reference.
