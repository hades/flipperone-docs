This page explains the structure of the Testing sub-project, provides links to public testing resources, and describes how to contribute to the sub-project.

The Testing sub-project covers checks for RK3576-based boards used in Flipper One development. Its goal is to turn each device feature into a repeatable test with a clear result. Testing currently prioritizes hardware verification, but test notes and assets can also cover user-interface or sound checks when those areas need repeatable pass/fail criteria.

The Testing sub-project consists of:

- ✅ [Task tracker](https://github.com/orgs/flipperdevices/projects/14)
- 📚 [Manual test descriptions](./#manual-test-descriptions)
- 📁 [Automated test scripts](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperone-testing)

***

## ✅ Task tracker

The public [Testing project board](https://github.com/orgs/flipperdevices/projects/14) tracks open work for the Testing sub-project. There, you can see what the team is working on, follow progress, and find tasks that need community help.

**Some tasks are open** to the community and marked with a **help wanted** label. You’re welcome to join the discussion on these tasks or submit test results when a task asks for them.

## 📚 Manual test descriptions

The Testing docs explain what should be checked for each subsystem. These pages are meant to complement the scripts: the docs describe the test goal, setup, expected result, and known gaps, while the repository contains runnable scripts or assets when they are available.

Docs in this section follow the same order as the navigation:

- [General](General.md) - boot targets, test images, and common setup notes.
- [Power](Power.md) - power-management testing notes.
- [Graphics](Graphics.md) - GPU, HDMI, USB-C DisplayPort, and no-graphics boot target checks.
  - [Video Decoding](Video-decoding.md) - video-decoding checks under graphics testing.
- [Network](Network.md) - Wi-Fi and Bluetooth test scenarios.
- [Expansion modules (M.2)](M_2.md) - M.2 expansion-module test notes.
  - [Cellular Modems](Cellular-Modems.md) - cellular modem tests for M.2 modules.

### Hardware verification

At this stage, testing is mainly used to verify whether each hardware component performs its intended function. A good test should answer a narrow question, for example:

- Does the interface come up?
- Does the expected device appear in Linux?
- Does the measured value stay inside the expected range?
- Does the output match the selected boot target?

Each test should end with a clear **YES/NO** or pass/fail result. When a result is not clear, document the exact observation and mark the open question instead of hiding it behind a vague pass.

### Test bench

TODO: Describe publicly available test setup.

## 📁 Automated test scripts

The public [flipperone-testing](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperone-testing) repository contains scripts and test assets for RK3576-based boards. It includes a shared test runner, module directories for major subsystems, and a `results/` directory layout for generated reports.

To avoid duplicating a fast-changing list of implemented tests here, use the repository [README](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperone-testing/blob/dev/README.md) as the current index of available automated checks, supported modules, and report formats.

## How to contribute

The Testing sub-project accepts contributions in three forms:
* **[Comments on open task](/.#comment-on-an-open-task)** with ideas, suggestions, and improvements.
* **[Testing and uploading test results](./#test-and-report-the-results)** to open testing tasks. 
* **[Pull requests for test improvements](./#contribute-via-a-pull-request)**.

### Test and report the results

Testing tasks are published in the [Task Tracker](https://github.com/orgs/flipperdevices/projects/14) with the **help wanted** label. Each testing task contains all essential testing requirements, as well as the expected format for submitting a test report.

Review the testing requirements and perform the test. Attach your test report as a comment in the task thread.
