The Developer Portal — also called the wiki or the Docs — is the main documentation for Flipper One sub-projects. We update it as we work on Flipper One, so some pages may be out of date. This page explains how the Docs are organized, how pages are stored and published, and how you can contribute.

![About Docs](/files/pics/about-docs-main-image.jpg)

The Docs sub-project covers all documentation for Flipper One: this wiki, technical specs, datasheets, guides, and contribution instructions. Like all other Flipper One sub-projects, it is open for community contribution.

The Docs sub-project consists of:

- ✅ :Link[Task tracker]{href="https://github.com/orgs/flipperdevices/projects/10" newTab="true" hasDisabledNofollow="true"}
- 📁 :Link[Source Markdown files on GitHub]{href="https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperone-docs" newTab="true" hasDisabledNofollow="true"}
- 📊 :Link[Diagrams on Miro]{href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVJ6y839o=/?moveToWidget=3458764666602002588&cot=10" newTab="true" hasDisabledNofollow="true"}

## How the Developer Portal works

The Flipper One Developer Portal is hosted on [Archbee](https://archbee.com), but all source files live in the :Link[GitHub repository]{href="https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipper-one-docs" newTab="true"} — made possible by Archbee's GitHub integration. Diagrams, screenshots, and illustrations are created in Miro and Figma, then exported to the repository alongside the Markdown.

![How the Developer Portal works](/files/pics/how-docs-work.jpg "How the Developer Portal works")

The repository uses two long-lived branches:

- `dev` — staging branch for documentation contributions. All pull requests from contributors target `dev` first, so changes can be reviewed, edited, and previewed without affecting the live site.
- `public-release` — production branch connected to Archbee. Once changes on `dev` are reviewed and ready, we promote them to `public-release`, which triggers Archbee to rebuild and publish the live docs at :Link[docs.flipper.net/one]{href="https://docs.flipper.net/one" newTab="true"}.

***

## ✅ Task tracker

All Docs sub-project tasks are tracked in the GitHub project [Flipper One — Docs](https://github.com/orgs/flipperdevices/projects/10). There, you can see what the team is working on and find open tasks where the community can help.

![Docs board explainer](/files/pics/docs-board-explainer.png "How the Docs task tracker is organized")

Tasks labeled **help wanted** are open for contribution. You're welcome to join discussions or submit changes — just read the :Link[Contribution guide]{href="./#how-to-contribute" newTab="false" hasDisabledNofollow="true"} first.

## 📁 GitHub repository structure

The :Link[flipperone-docs]{href="https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperone-docs" newTab="true"} repository contains the source files for the entire Developer Portal:

```none
flipperone-docs/
├── archbee.json           # Sidebar hierarchy + Archbee integration settings
├── README.md              # Repository overview

```

### Markdown and Archbee syntax

All pages in the Developer Portal are written in **Markdown** (`.md`) — the same format used for GitHub READMEs and most open-source documentation. On top of standard Markdown, Archbee adds a set of components for callouts, tabs, workflow blocks, embedded media, and more.

For the full list of supported syntax with live examples, see the :Link[Markup example]{href="./Markup-example.md" newTab="true" hasDisabledNofollow="true"} page. It covers:

- Headings, lists, links, and tables
- Callouts
- Images and videos
- Code blocks and tabbed code
- Workflow steps and other Archbee components

:::hint{type="info"}
Always check the :Link[Markup example]{href="./Markup-example.md" newTab="true" hasDisabledNofollow="true"} page before writing or editing — some Markdown features behave differently in Archbee, and component syntax can be easy to mistype.
:::

***

### Images and other assets

All images, diagrams, and screenshots live in a single folder: `docs/files/pics/`. Keeping everything in one place makes it easier to find, reuse, and clean up unused files.

To use an image in a page, reference it from your Markdown using a relative path:

```markdown
![Caption text](/files/pics/your-image.png)
```

For richer Archbee image syntax (positioning, captions, sizing), see the :Link[Markup example]{href="./Markup-example.md" newTab="true" hasDisabledNofollow="true"} page.

‎

**Naming and size guidelines:**

- Use descriptive, lowercase filenames with hyphens — for example, `gpio-pinout.png`, not `IMG_0042.PNG`.
- Compress large screenshots before committing. Keep individual files under a few MB where possible.
- Prefer `.png` for screenshots and diagrams, `.jpg` for photos.

***

### How archbee.json works

`archbee.json` lives at the repo root and defines the Developer Portal's left sidebar (table of contents): sections, page names, file paths, and nesting levels.

When adding a new page, always update :Link[archbee.json]{href="https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperone-docs/blob/public-release/archbee.json" newTab="true"} to include it. Without this, the page will not appear in the sidebar, and readers won't be able to find it.

**Syntax**

The sidebar tree lives in `structure.docsTree` — an array of entries that are either pages or category groups. For example:

```json
{
  "root": "./docs",
  "structure": {
    "readme": "Welcome.md",
    "assets": "files",
    "docsTree": [
      {
        "categoryName": "Welcome",
        "isCategory": false,
        "path": "Welcome.md",
        "children": []
      },
      {
        "categoryName": "🔌 Hardware",
        "isCategory": true,
        "children": [
          {
            "categoryName": "About Hardware",
            "isCategory": false,
            "path": "hardware/About-Hardware.md",
            "children": []
          },
          {
            "categoryName": "GPIO port",
            "isCategory": false,
            "path": "hardware/GPIO-port.md",
            "children": [
              {
                "categoryName": "GPIO modules",
                "isCategory": false,
                "path": "hardware/GPIO-Modules.md",
                "children": []
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

‎&#x20;

**Rules**

- Pages are entries with a path to an `.md` file inside `docs/`.
- Categories are group headers that visually separate sections (for example, 🔌 Hardware). They have no path — only nested entries.
- Any page can also have nested sub-pages under it.
- The sidebar label comes from `categoryName`. Emojis render as-is and are purely cosmetic.

**Page metadata**

Every page starts with a YAML frontmatter block at the top of the `.md` file. Archbee reads two fields from it:

- `title:` — the page title shown as the H1 on the live site and as the page name in the sidebar. Do not add a `# Title` line in the body — Archbee will render it twice.
- `slug:` — the URL path under `docs.flipper.net/one/`.

Example:

```markdown
---
title: About Docs
slug: resources/about-docs
---
```

**Adding a new page**

1. Create the `.md` file under `docs/...` and set the `title:` and `slug:` fields in the frontmatter.
2. Add an entry for it in `archbee.json` → `structure.docsTree` at the right place in the hierarchy. Ideally, nesting should not go deeper than two levels.
3. Open a pull request to the `dev` branch. After review, your changes are promoted to `public-release`, which rebuilds the live site.

## 📊 Diagrams on Miro

![Miro board example](/files/pics/miro-example.png "Flipper One — Docs Miro board")

All diagrams used in the Developer Portal, architecture overviews, flow charts, and conceptual visuals are designed on the [Flipper One — Docs Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVJ6y839o=/).

The board is publicly viewable: anyone can open it, inspect existing diagrams and templates, and export a copy for reference or offline editing.

## 🎨 Illustrations on Figma

![Figma file example](/files/pics/figma-example.png "Flipper One — Docs Figma file")

Illustrations used across the Developer Portal — section illustrations and decorative graphics are designed in the [Flipper One — Docs Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/HcwlmmIJlW4LoiQu4RtwwH/Flipper-One-%E2%80%94-Docs).

Like the Miro board, the Figma file is publicly viewable: you can browse every frame, inspect layers, and export illustrations at any resolution.

**Fork the repository.** Go to :Link[flipperone-docs]{href="https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperone-docs" newTab="true"} and click **Fork** in the upper-right corner. Your fork opens on the `dev` branch — our staging branch for contributions. All your work happens here.
:::

:::WorkflowBlockItem
**Edit or create your&#x20;**`.md`**&#x20;file.** In your fork, find the file you want to edit under `docs/`, or create a new one in the appropriate subfolder. Follow the syntax shown on the Markup example page — some Markdown features behave differently in Archbee.
:::

:::WorkflowBlockItem
**(Optional) Add images.** If your change includes images, diagrams, or screenshots, upload them to `docs/files/pics/` and reference them with a relative path:

```markdown
![Alt text](/files/pics/your-image.png "Caption")
```

Use descriptive, lowercase filenames with hyphens (e.g. `gpio-pinout.png`). Keep images under 1 MB.
:::

:::WorkflowBlockItem
**(Optional) Register the new page in&#x20;**:Link[archbee.json]{href="https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperone-docs/blob/public-release/archbee.json" newTab="true"}**.** Place it in the sidebar hierarchy (no deeper than two levels) — see :Link[How archbee.json works]{href="./#how-archbeejson-works" newTab="false" hasDisabledNofollow="true"} for the syntax. It's okay to skip — we'll update the file after merging your PR.
:::
