This page explains how the Docs sub-project works — how the Developer Portal is structured, how source files are stored and published, and how you can contribute.

\<image placeholder>

The Docs sub-project covers all documentation for Flipper One: this wiki, technical specs, datasheets, guides, and contribution instructions. Like all other Flipper One sub-projects, it is open for community contribution.

The Docs sub-project consists of:

- ✅ :Link[Task tracker]{href="https://github.com/orgs/flipperdevices/projects/10" newTab="true" hasDisabledNofollow="true"}
- 📁 :Link[Source Markdown files on GitHub]{href="https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperone-docs" newTab="true" hasDisabledNofollow="true"}
- 📊 :Link[Diagrams on Miro]{href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVJ6y839o=/?moveToWidget=3458764666602002588&cot=10" newTab="true" hasDisabledNofollow="true"}
- 🎨 :Link[Illustrations on Figma]{href="https://www.figma.com/design/HcwlmmIJlW4LoiQu4RtwwH/Flipper-One-%E2%80%94-Docs?node-id=71-3&t=56y5oAygKLBg3nGe-1" newTab="true" hasDisabledNofollow="true"}

We'd love your feedback and help — look for tasks tagged **help wanted** in the task tracker, or contribute directly to the Docs GitHub repository via pull requests.

# How the Developer Portal works

The Flipper One Developer Portal is hosted on [**Archbee**](https://archbee.com), but all source files live in the :Link[flipper-one-docs GitHub repository]{href="https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipper-one-docs" newTab="true" hasDisabledNofollow="false"} — made possible by Archbee's GitHub integration. Diagrams, screenshots, and illustrations are created in Miro and Figma, then exported to the repository alongside the Markdown.

:::hint{type="info"}
**In short:** GitHub is the source of truth for all text, images, and page hierarchy. Archbee reads from GitHub and renders the live site at :Link[docs.flipper.net/one]{href="https://docs.flipper.net/one" newTab="true" hasDisabledNofollow="false"}.
:::

Whenever a pull request is merged into the `public-release` branch, Archbee automatically rebuilds the site with the changes.

# Repository structure

The repository contains the source files for the entire Developer Portal:

## How Summary.md works

`Summary.md` defines the left sidebar (table of contents) of the Developer Portal. It defines sections, page names, file paths, and nesting levels. Ideally, nesting should not go deeper than two levels.

When adding a new page, always update :Link[docs/Summary.md ]{href="https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperone-docs/blob/public-release/docs/Summary.md" newTab="true" hasDisabledNofollow="false"}to include it. Without this, the page will not appear in the sidebar, and readers won't be able to find it.

### Syntax

The file uses nested Markdown bullet lists with ## category headings. For example:

```markdown
- [Welcome](Welcome.md)
- [How to join](How-to-join.md)

## 🔌 Hardware
- [About Hardware](hardware/About-Hardware.md)
- [GPIO port](hardware/GPIO-port.md)
- [Expansion modules](hardware/modules/Expansion-modules.md)
  - [GPIO modules](hardware/modules/GPIO-Modules.md)
  - [M.2 modules](hardware/modules/M2-Modules.md)
```

‎&#x20;

### Rules

- A bullet of the form `- [Title](path.md)` becomes a navigable page. The path is relative to the `docs/` folder.
- A `## Heading` line becomes a category group that visually separates sections (for example, `## Hardware`).
- Indented bullets (two spaces per level) become sub-pages nested under the parent page.
- Emojis in titles render as-is in the sidebar. They are purely cosmetic and used for quick visual scanning.

:::hint{type="info"}
**Page names in the sidebar** come from the first H1 heading (`#`) in the `.md` file — not from the square brackets in `Summary.md`. Keep page titles short so they fit comfortably in the sidebar.

This is a known issue — we notified Archbee.
:::

‎&#x20;

### How to add a new page

1. Create the `.md` file under `docs/...`
2. Add a bullet to `Summary.md` at the right place in the hierarchy.
3. Open a pull request. The live site rebuilds on merge.

If you forget step 3, the page may publish without the correct sidebar position. Always update both files in the same pull request.

# ✅ Task tracker

All Docs sub-project tasks are tracked in the GitHub project [**Flipper One — Docs**](https://github.com/orgs/flipperdevices/projects/10). There, you can see what the team is working on and find open tasks where the community can help.

![](https://api.archbee.com/api/optimize/3StCFqarJkJQZV-7N79yY/thnPuI0oZ2C2o4ekvaFP2-20260421-151307.jpg "Update for the Docs sub-project")

Tasks labeled **help wanted** are open for contribution. You're welcome to join discussions or submit changes — just read the contribution guide below first.

# 📊 Diagrams on Miro

All diagrams used in the Developer Portal, architecture overviews, flow charts, and conceptual visuals are designed on the [**Flipper One — Docs Miro board**](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVJ6y839o=/).

The board is publicly viewable: anyone can open it, inspect a diagram, and export a copy for reference or offline editing. Once a diagram is finalized, it's exported as an image and committed to `docs/files/pics/` in the repository — that exported file is what actually renders in the live docs.

:::hint{type="info"}
Spotted an error or have an idea for a new diagram? Share them with us in a :Link[pull request]{href="https://docs.flipper.net/one/about-docs#share-fixes-and-guides-as-a-pull-request" newTab="true" hasDisabledNofollow="false"}.
:::

# 🎨 Illustrations on Figma

Illustrations used across the Developer Portal — section illustrations and decorative graphics are designed in the [**Flipper One — Docs Figma file**](https://www.figma.com/design/HcwlmmIJlW4LoiQu4RtwwH/Flipper-One-%E2%80%94-Docs).

Like the Miro board, the Figma file is publicly viewable: you can browse every frame, inspect layers, and export illustrations at any resolution. Finalized illustrations are exported to `docs/files/pics/` in the repository, which is what the live site renders.

:::hint{type="info"}
Have an idea for a new illustration or a tweak to an existing one? Share them with us in a :Link[pull request]{href="https://docs.flipper.net/one/about-docs#share-fixes-and-guides-as-a-pull-request" newTab="true" hasDisabledNofollow="false"}.
