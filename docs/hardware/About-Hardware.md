This page explains the structure of the Hardware sub-project, provides links to its resources, and outlines how to contribute to Flipper One's electrical hardware development.

![About Hardware](/files/pics/about-hardware-main.png)

The Hardware sub-project covers electrical hardware development: printed circuit boards (PCBs), antennas, schematics, and everything related to the electrical connections of chips, connectors, and processors. The Hardware team works closely with the Mechanics team to ensure the electronics are compatible with the enclosure.

The Hardware sub-project consists of:

## ⚡ Schematics and PCB design on Altium 365

Selected parts of Flipper One's electrical design — schematics, PCB layouts, and BOM — are hosted on :Link[Altium 365]{href="https://flipper.365.altium.com/designs/folder-A78C8D02-EA07-49E1-AC7A-E84FAA2AF410" newTab="true" hasDisabledNofollow="false"}, the cloud collaboration platform for circuit design. Altium 365 hosts the latest version of the shared design files; you can view them in your browser without installing any software.

![Altium 365 Web Viewer interface](/files/pics/altium-ui-general.png)

Click any project in the Flipper One folder to open it in the Web Viewer with five view tabs along the top — **SCH** (schematic), **PCB** (2D layout), **3D** (interactive 3D render), **Draftsman** (fabrication documentation), and **BOM** (Bill of Materials).

Click any project in the Flipper One folder to open it in the Web Viewer. Five view tabs are available along the top:

- **SCH** — schematic
- **PCB** — 2D layout
- **3D** — interactive 3D render
- **Draftsman** — fabrication documentation
- **BOM** — Bill of Materials

The Web Viewer can export the entire project or individual derived files for offline reference.

::::WorkflowBlock
:::WorkflowBlockItem
**Open a project and click the Downloads icon** in the top-right of the viewer. A panel opens with Project Source Files and Derived Files sections.
:::

:::WorkflowBlockItem
**Download the whole project.** In Project Source Files, click the project entry to download all source files as a single archive.
:::

:::WorkflowBlockItem
**Or download individual files.** In Derived Files, pick what you need — Gerber, Assembly Docs, PDF Schematic, STEP, or BOM.
:::
::::

For full info about the download feature, see Altium's :Link[official Web Viewer documentation]{href="https://www.altium.com/documentation/altium-365/viewers/web-viewer#downloading" newTab="true" hasDisabledNofollow="false"}.

## 📚 Docs

Hardware documentation is split across two sections:

- 🔌 **Hardware section** (you're here) — port pinouts, modules, and subsystem references (Wi-Fi & Bluetooth, power, M.2, GPIO).
- :Link[🧪 Testing section]{href="../testing/About-Testing.md" newTab="true" hasDisabledNofollow="true"} — hardware verification procedures for each subsystem.

See also the :Link[Tech specs]{href="https://docs.flipper.net/one/general/tech-specs" newTab="true" hasDisabledNofollow="false"} page for full hardware specifications in one place.

***

## How to contribute

The Hardware sub-project accepts contributions in two forms: **comments on open tasks** for ideas, suggestions, and improvements, and **edits to the docs** for documenting hardware experiments, findings, or external module designs.

***

### Suggest your change as a comment on an open task

::::hint{type="info"}
**⚠️ Contributions only — no flooding**

To keep collaboration productive, please keep comments on-topic. Open tasks are for contribution-related discussion only. If you have an idea or concern, first turn it into a concrete contribution and share it as a comment on a task. For general questions or discussions, you're always welcome to join the conversation on :Link[social media]{href="https://x.com/Flipper_RND" newTab="true" hasDisabledNofollow="false"} or :Link[Discord]{href="https://discord.com/invite/flipper" newTab="true" hasDisabledNofollow="false"}!

### Contribute to the docs

If you've spotted an error in the Hardware section, want to clarify something, or want to share your hardware experiments and findings, you're welcome to contribute by editing the docs. The fastest way to jump straight to a page's source is the **Edit on GitHub** button on the live site — it opens the page's `.md` file directly in the GitHub editor.

![Contribute to the Hardware docs](/files/pics/hardware-contribute-to-docs.jpg)

For a longer change, fork the repository, make your edits on a new branch, and open a pull request:

::::WorkflowBlock
:::WorkflowBlockItem
**Read the&#x20;**:Link[Markup example]{href="https://docs.flipper.net/one/resources/about-docs/markup-example" newTab="true"}**&#x20;page** to learn the supported Markdown and Archbee syntax.
:::

:::WorkflowBlockItem
**Fork the repository.** Go to :Link[flipperone-docs]{href="https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperone-docs" newTab="true"} and click **Fork** in the upper-right corner. Your fork opens on the `dev` branch — our staging branch for contributions. All your work happens here.
:::

:::WorkflowBlockItem
**Edit or create your&#x20;**`.md`**&#x20;file.** In your fork, find the file you want to edit under `docs/hardware/`, or create a new one in the appropriate subfolder. Follow the syntax shown on the Markup example page — some Markdown features behave differently in Archbee.
:::

:::WorkflowBlockItem
**(Optional) Add images.** If your change includes images, diagrams, or screenshots, upload them to `docs/files/pics/` and reference them with a relative path:

```markdown
![Alt text](/files/pics/your-image.png "Caption")
```

Use descriptive, lowercase filenames with hyphens (e.g. `gpio-pinout.png`). Keep images under 1 MB.
:::

:::WorkflowBlockItem
**(Optional) Register the new page in&#x20;**:Link[archbee.json]{href="https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperone-docs/blob/public-release/archbee.json" newTab="true"}**.** Place it in the sidebar hierarchy (no deeper than two levels) — see :Link[How archbee.json works]{href="https://docs.flipper.net/one/resources/about-docs#how-archbeejson-works" newTab="true"} for the syntax. It's okay to skip — we'll update the file after merging your PR.
:::

:::WorkflowBlockItem
**Create a branch and commit.** Name the branch `nickname/what-changed` (e.g. `john/gpio-module-experiment`). Keep commit messages concise — e.g. `Add: GPIO module pinout reference`.
:::

:::WorkflowBlockItem
**Open a pull request from your branch to the original repository.** The target is pre-selected to `dev` — leave it as is. Add a clear title and description, and ideally attach screenshots and a link to the related open task.

After review, we promote your changes from `dev` to `public-release`, which publishes them to the live site.
:::
::::

Once your pull request is merged into `dev` and later promoted to `public-release`, Archbee automatically picks up the changes and rebuilds the live site at :Link[docs.flipper.net/one]{href="https://docs.flipper.net/one" newTab="true"}.
